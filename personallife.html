    He currently lives outside Manchester, although he still has a home in
    Malmö where he spends his time of the field.<br />
    Among his trophies, Ibrahimović has also received an honorary
    black belt in taekwondo. Zlatan is fluent in
    five languages, Swedish, Bosnian, English, Spanish and Italian.
     The soccer star is both Muslim and Catholic, coming from his
    parents. Zlatan's confidence has helped him make a name for himself
    , literally, the name Zlatan was trademarked in May 2003 at the
    Swedish Patent and Registration Office.

<h2 id="Controversials"> Controversies </h2>

<center>
  <p>Ibrahimović has been involved in many violent situations
     with teammates.
     For example, former Ajax teammate Rafael van der Vaart
     publicly accused Ibrahimović of deliberately injuring him
     during the game. Ibrahimović responded by threatening to
     break both of Van der Vaart's legs. <br />
     Another incident is when Zlatan punched Ajax teammate, Mido, in the
     dressing room after the he had thrown a pair of scissors
     at him. <br />
     But despite the violence and arrogance, his fans have remained
     loyal to him and gained more love for the soccer star.
